    <h1>The Best Movies According to Nihal</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Fate: Heavean's Feel (Trilogy)</h3>
    <p>This is the recent anime movie that I've watched and it shows the exciting and spine chilling action scenes. <br>
    I have always loved action and adventure anime a lot, this story follows a darker alternate path to the end of the holy grail war. <br>
    Make sure you give it a try.</p>
    <h3>Avenger's: End-game</h3>
    <p>This is the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe(MCU). <br>
    It shows the end to the age of Avengers as they defeat their final boss.</p>
    <h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
    <p>This is the anime movie which show cases the srtuggle of a young deaf girl who falls in love the boy who has social anxiety. <br>
    As the story progresses it reveals a emotional relationship between two of them. <br>
    I totally recommend to give it a shot.</p>
